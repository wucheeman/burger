[p] Application has package.json
[p] server.js requires express and body-parser.
[p] db has this structure:

[p] seeds.sql has at least three entries
[p] connection.js connects Node to MySQL.
[p] connection.js exports the connection.
[p] `orm.js` requires `connection.js`
[p] orm.js contains an object that provides these methods to execute MySQL commands in the controllers to  retrieve and store data in the db:
     ()`selectAll()`

     ()`updateOne()`
[p] orm.js exports the ORM object.
[p] `burger.js` file imports `orm.js` into `burger.js`
