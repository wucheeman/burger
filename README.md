# Eat-da-Burger!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the Eat-da-Burger app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the app
You can use the application online at Heroku eventually, but it's not yet ready.

If you want to install the app locally, you will need MySQL and Node.js, installed. On Windows, you will need Git Bash. Once you have them on your machine:

1. Install the database from the command line by in the project's root directory by entering ($ is the prompt):
  $ bash ./setupDB.sh (Windows)
  $ ./setupDB.sh (Mac/Linux)
Note this script has only been tested on Windows, but the command should work.

## Authors
This game is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
