# Eat-da-Burger!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the Eat-da-Burger app, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the app
You can use the application online at Heroku eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This game is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
